## Steps

The main steps involved in this project are:

1. Setting up the development environment.
2. Understanding the basics of web scraping.
3. Analyzing the website structure of InfoJobs.
4. Writing the Python code to extract job data from InfoJobs.
5. Saving the extracted data to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming and HTML structure. You will also need the following Python packages:

- Selenium
- Time
- pandas

If you're working in a Jupyter Notebook environment, you can install any additional packages using `!pip install packagename` within a notebook cell. For example:

- `!pip install pandas`
